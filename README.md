# Webpack 4 + React + Babel Boilerplate

So I want to build my own React boilerplate, with Webpack and Babel.

I have been learning React and webpack for some time now. I used react's recommended `create-react-app` to start an new app, but I always feel that it doesn't fulfill my needs.

I used Grunt before, but now that I'm learning Webpack, I'd like to use it in my projects. And I really like using Webpack to process and bundle my files.
